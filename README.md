## About

`grid-builder` is a modular `snakemake` workflow for constructing power grid models from OpenStreetMap data for use in energy system modelling. It can be imported directly into any `snakemake` workflow.

Starting from raw OpenStreetMap data, the workflow extracts high-voltage grid components, including substations, transmission lines, cables, transformers, and converters. Missing electrical parameters such as voltage levels and line counts are then inferred heuristically using region-specific assumptions on asset types and standards. The output is a model-ready power grid network compatible with [PyPSA-Eur](https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur), [PyPSA-Earth](https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-earth), and other energy system modelling frameworks.

<!-- Please do not modify this templated section -->

This is a modular `snakemake` workflow created as part of the [Modelblocks project](https://www.modelblocks.org/). It can be imported directly into any `snakemake` workflow.

For more information, please consult the Modelblocks [documentation](https://modelblocks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
the [integration example](./tests/integration/Snakefile),
and the `snakemake` [documentation](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/modularization.html).

## Overview
<!-- Please describe the processing stages of this module here -->

Data processing steps:

1. Download OSM power infrastructure data
2. Clean and infer electrical network attributes
3. Build connected network topology
4. Validate network model

## Configuration
<!-- Please describe how to configure this module below -->

Please consult the configuration [README](./config/README.md) and the [configuration example](./config/config.yaml) for a general overview on the configuration options of this module.

## Input / output structure
<!-- Please describe input / output file placement below -->

Please consult the [interface file](./INTERFACE.yaml) for more information.

## Development
<!-- Please do not modify this templated section -->

We use [`pixi`](https://pixi.sh/) as our package manager for development.
Once installed, run the following to clone this repository and install all dependencies.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:PyPSA/grid-builder.git
cd grid-builder
pixi install --all
```

Please be aware that this is a multi-environment project (see [pixi.toml](./pixi.toml) for details).
- `default`: used for development and integration testing.
Because it contains `Snakemake`, `conda` and `pytest` as dependencies it **should not be used** in `Snakemake` rules.
- `module`: contains minimal dependencies used in `Snakemake` rules.
If modified, be sure to export it to `Snakemake` so it can be recreated by module users:

```shell
# create module.yaml and conda-spec pin files in workflow/envs/
pixi run export-snakemake-env module
```


## Testing
<!-- Please do not modify this templated section -->

For testing, simply run:

```shell
pixi run test-integration
```

To test a minimal example of a workflow using this module:

```shell
pixi shell    # activate this project's environment
cd tests/integration/  # navigate to the integration example
snakemake --use-conda --cores 2  # run the workflow!
```
